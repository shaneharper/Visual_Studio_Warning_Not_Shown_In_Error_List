This demonstrates that the items displayed in Visual Studio's Error List window when "Build + IntelliSense" is selected are not always the union of the items displayed when "Build" is selected and the items displayed when "IntelliSense" is selected. This project might demonstrate a bug in Visual Studio v17.5.4.

A CS8602 warning ("Dereference of a possibly null reference.") only appears in the Error List when "Build" is selected but not when "Build + IntelliSense" is selected if Program.cs was open in a Visual Studio editor window at the time it was compiled. (Though if Program.cs wasn't open in an editor window when it was compiled then the CS8602 warning does appear when "Build + IntelliSense" is selected. To see this use "Build/Rebuild Solution" if necessary to force recompilation of Program.cs.)
